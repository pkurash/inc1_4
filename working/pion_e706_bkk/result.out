 
  STRUCTURE FUNCTIONS FROM PDFLIB
  THE PROTON STRUCT FUNCT. ARE FROM THE PDFLIB TABLES: NGROUP =  3 NSET = 68
  THE PROTON : LAMBDA=  0.300



    PROJECTILE=proton    
    TARGET=NUCLEUS    with  Z=   4. A=   9.
   cross sections are given per nucleon without corrections for nuclear effects
 
  ORDER OF STR. FUN.= 1  CONVENTION OF STR. FUN.= 0
  LAMBDA IN STR. FUN.=  0.3 GeV LAMBDA IN ALFAS=  0.3 GeV
  Q02 VALUES : FOR PROTON Q02=  1.25GeV^2  FOR PION=  1.25GeV^2
