Working version of old INCNLO generator (needed additional options for gfortran command in merge/src/Makefile_home)

Other Makefiles should be changed similarly when building on other systems (see materials in folder doc for explanation)

Requires newest version of cernlib which can be downloaded here: https://cernlib.web.cern.ch/version.html

TODO: implement most recent PDF-s (https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/pdfsets.html) in Fortan/C++
